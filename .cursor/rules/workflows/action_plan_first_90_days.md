  - For example, check if the following are not expectations for you:
    - Lead regular one-on-ones to provide feedback and discuss engineers’ career paths.
    - Connect engineers with growth opportunities.
    - Take engineers' needs and concerns into consideration.
    - Code Review / Low-level design review
    - Create an inclusive environment where engineers feel safe to grow.
    - Provide assistance in the resolution of technical issues.



### Phase 2 Key Actions:

- Organize a list of issues by category and priority.
  - And discuss it with bosses and tech lead.
- Suggest/discuss some small updates to the UI or workflow.
- Making decisions about what features the team will work on next.
- Describe a backlog item that your team will work on soon.
- Identify goals and identify whether the current resources are enough to achieve objectives
